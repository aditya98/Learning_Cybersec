First line is generally denotimg licence type in the smart contracts. Written in comments

Actual first line for the solidity program is:
pragma solidity ^0.8.19; //indicates that program is compatible until this part of solidity version

Start by writing your contract using the keyword contract. Give it a name, e.g., SimpleStorage. Everything inside the curly brackets will be considered part of this contract.
```

pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract SimpleStorage {

}
```
Question can a program have multiple contract declarations?
